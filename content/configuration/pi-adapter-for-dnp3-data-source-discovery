# Data source discovery

A discovery against the data source of a DNP3 adapter allows you to specify the optional **query** parameter. The discovery query defines which outstations to discover.

**Note:** Only one discovery at a time is supported.

## Query string

The string of the **query** parameter may contain string items in the following form: <br>`OutstationIds=<id>,<id2>,<id3>,...`<br><br>
| String item      | Required | Description |
|------------------|----------|-------------|
| **OutstationIds**  | Optional |  The outstation IDs to be discovered.<br>**Note:** To specify multiple outstation IDs in the query, separate the outstation IDs with a comma. If **OutstationIds** is not specified, the adapter will perform discovery for each outstation in the data source. |

**Note:** An outstation id is a user-defined identifier for an outstation in the data source configuration.

### Query rules

The following rules apply for specifying the query string:

- Multiple comma-separated outstationIds are supported.
- Each outstation ID specified in the query string must be present in the data source.
- `OutstationIds=` must be followed by a outstationId.
- Empty string and all white spaces string is equivalent to no query specified.
- White spaces in the `OutstationIds=` section of the query are not supported

**Note:** The data source might contain many outstations, or outstations that already have corresponding data selection items. Use `OutstationIds` to limit discovery to the outstations that should be discovered.

## Discovery query example

The query parameter of the DNP3 component must be specified as shown in this example:
`OutstationIds=Outstation1,Outstation2`.

### Data source discovery initiation

```json
{
    "id" : "SampleA",
    "query" : "OutstationIds=Outstation1,Outstation2"
}
```

### Data source discovery results

```json
[
    {
        "id": "SampleA",
        "query": "OutstationIds=Outstation1,Outstation2",
        "startTime": "2020-12-14T14:19:01.4383791-08:00",
        "endTime": "2020-12-14T14:19:31.8549164-08:00",
        "progress": 30,
        "itemsFound": 700,
        "newItems": 200,
        "resultUri": "http://127.0.0.1:5590/api/v1/Configuration/DNP3-1/Discoveries/SampleA/result",
        "autoSelect": false,
        "status": "Complete",
        "errors": null
    }
]
```

### DNP3 discovered selection items

The following items are an example of what might be discovered on Outstation1 and Outstation2. This will vary based on what is returned by the integrity scan used for discovery. 

```json
[
  {
    "outstationId": "Outstation1",
    "group": 1,
    "index": 0,
  },
  {
    "outstationId": "Outstation1",
    "group": 30,
    "index": 0,
  },
  {
    "outstationId": "Outstation1",
    "group": 20,
    "index": 0,
  },
  {
    "outstationId": "Outstation2",
    "group": 3,
    "index": 1,
  },
  {
    "outstationId": "Outstation2",
    "group": 30,
    "index": 2,
  }
]
```
